This is my first project at the University of Northampton for my CSY1018 class (Web Development).
The assignment is to create 4 personal web pages that include a CV, short bio, contact information and a home page.
Estimated time spent on assignment = 12hours

During the initial stages of the development I designed multiple wireframes so I would have an idea of how I wanted my website to look. The following wireframes show what my first draft of each web page would look like. I have attempted to keep to my designs when producing my finished website as I liked the simple design as it doesn’t look messy and overcrowded as I feel this would look unprofessional. (The wireframes have been included in under Supporting_documents/README-16441847.docx in my submission folder)
I have included links to all the pages of the website across the header of all pages and have added a slight colour change when the cursor is hovering over the link using CSS.
My code has been commented to show what sections edit which part as I believe this will help anyone who wishes to collaborate with me on developing the website further as it is clear what code is used where. No code and has been externally sourced.
Google Web fonts have been used successfully. I have chosen a monospace font as I think it looks good and is a little different to most normal webpages.
The contact page has been set up correctly however, the “send email” button does not do anything. With further development, this will eventually be changed to physically send an email.
All font sizes have been expressed in em terms instead of pixels.
I have used a CSS flexbox for both my index and cv pages as these pages I had content that I wanted to group together so when the window size changes they will stay together and not completely change the webpage design.
I was unable to link the top left parts of the pages back to the first page as because I simply had my name there, as I was going for a simple design, when I included a “a href” link the text would be underlined and this was not something I liked so chose not to include this. I could have used a CSS command such as “text-decoration: none;” however I wanted to use a custom font and text size and this could not have been achieved with the text-decoration rule.
A favicon has been added to the browser tab and was converted into an ico file type using the webpage specified above.
There is has only been the use of HTML and CSS to complete this assignment, as specified in the brief, and not framework software was used to create my final webpages.
